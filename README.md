# ReadMe - Bloom
Bloom is a mobile application (Android and iOS) for personal development made with React Native technology.

## Description
### Inspiration
Today many people are confronted with the problem of time management and guilt in case of inactivity. Our application is meant to be a source of inspiration, motivation but also a real assistant throughout your day. Whether you want to learn the violin, prepare for your exams or face a marathon, our application will accompany you every day. In order for you to become the best version of yourself, Bloom offers you tips and techniques to accomplish your personal and professional goals.

### What that's do
Bloom allows, thanks to its generative language model, to generate lists of activities related to your goals. You can enter the completion of your tasks, the productivity during the activities and the fatigue felt. The home screen allows you to view your previous statistics. You can also add activities manually to the list. Bloom is available on Android and IOS.

### How it works
The frontend is a mobile application (Android and iOS) developed in React Native.

### Difficulties met
This weekend was our very first Hackathon experience. We took advantage of new technologies. So we started from scratch to learn React Native, communication with Google Api and Å•egular expressions. Numerous mistakes and long hours of debugging punctuated our weekend.

### What we proud of
We didn't know any of the technologies used. Coming from cybersecurity, system architecture and DevOps, none of us were used to working on software development, but we challenged ourselves. We're proud of what we were able to deliver and look forward to participating in future editions and doing even better with the organizational lessons we learned.
